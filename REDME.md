# pyFitXPS

The aim of this project is helping in XPS data fitting for secuencial data; e.g.: Irradiation Damage for Self-Assembled Monolayers of Molecules on Surface.

This project contain several function wich allow to load **.xy files** generated by **SpecLab Prodigy** software from SPECS. Also have others functions to select _"data to range"_, fit the _Fermi Edge_ and _shift the energy scale_.

In this project, the data are managed by **dictionaries**. The idea to use dictionary is to stroe all data, and fit result in one objet, which can be saved easily.

The fit procedures are realised using LMFIT. The fit result are stored in the same dictionary wich contain the original data. 

The XPS peaks are fitted using similar aproches than is commonly used in IgorPro by **XPSDOniach** procedures. 

This project uses the most precise physical focus during the tuning process. The functions used for the adjustment are built by means of the convolution of a peak function (Lorenztian or Donian-Sunjic) with a Gaussian function of the measurement process.

## TODO

### Loading files

- [x] Read one .XY file for separated region from SpecLab Prodigy software.
- [ ] Read one .XY file for "all data in one file".
- [ ] Read .XY file for separated scans.
- [ ]

### Fitting procedures

- [x] Functions to fit Fermi Edge

### Manage data

- [x] Correct energy scale.
